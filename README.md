#CrossGene
CrossGene is a software that biology (and related) students might find usefull.
When the development stage is finished, CrossGene will allow:
 - Generation of full-size Punnet Squares (and a CSV export option)
 - Calculating the probability of each genotype and fenotype to occur
 - I'm also thinking about adding an option to predict if a child of two parents will
be ill basing on the family illnes history, but this one will be developed later.
